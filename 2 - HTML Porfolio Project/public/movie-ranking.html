<p>This one's a given. I'm a huge Marvel fan, and all the storylines of the previous phases came 
    together in this movie. Wish it was possible to see it again for the first time. </p>
<h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>
<a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10872600/"> <img src = 
    "https://www.theworkprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Spidey-NWH-Featured.jpg" width = "40%" /> </a>
<p>A long-awaited movie. The movie theater was SO loud as soon as Tobey and Andrew walked in the scene. 
    LOVE Andrew so much and love the three of them working together. Action-packed movie for the ages. </p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/"> <img src = 
    "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdmY2RmN2UtMjZhMi00MDI2LTk5NDYtMDBkZDI3ZmM3NmQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTc3MjUzNTI@._V1_.jpg"

<p>Super beautiful film. Space is so mysterious and this movie captures it perfectly, all while playing with your
    heartstrings in the scenes with Coop and Murph. Pretty confusing, but that's what makes it so good.</p>
